# planning_for_autonomous_robots
This repository holds the exercises and the final project I had to solve individually for the course at ETH "Planning for Autonomous Robots", delivered by Prof Emilio Frazzoli. Access to private libraries is required to run the code.

TOPICS
  EX 01 - Simple exercise to start
  EX 02 - Graph Seach with Depth-First and Breadth-First
  EX 03 - Shortest Path with Uniform Cost and A*
  EX 04 - Value Iteration, Policy Iteration
  EX 05 - Dubins Path
  EX 06 - Algorithms for Collision checking
  EX 07 - Linear Programs for Trajectory Planning
  EX 08 (Final Project) 
  	- Rapidly-exploring Random Graph for trajectory planning
  	- PID controller for trajectory tracking
  	- Heuristics to avoid collision with other agents
