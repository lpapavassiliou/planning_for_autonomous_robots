# planning_for_autonomous_robots
This repository holds the exercise I had to solve individually for the course at ETH "Planning for Autonomous Robots", delivered by Prof Emilio Frazzoli.
Access to private libraries is required to run the code.

ex1 - quick exercise to start
ex2 - graph search with Depth-First and Breadth-First
ex3 - shortest path with A-star
ex4 - value iteration and policy iteration on a grid map
ex5 - dubins path planner
ex6 - collision checking with geometry
ex7 - planning with linear programs
ex8 - (Final Project)
        - Rapidly-exploring Random Graph for trajectory planning
        - PID for trajectory tracking with cars
        - Heuristics for multi-agent steering
