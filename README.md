# planning_for_autonomous_robots
This repository holds the exercises and the final project I had to solve individually for the course at ETH "Planning for Autonomous Robots", delivered by Prof Emilio Frazzoli. Code available in "/src/exercises". Access to private libraries is required to run the code.

TOPICS

  EX 01 - Simple exercise to start
  
  EX 02 - Graph Seach with Depth-First and Breadth-First
  
  EX 03 - Shortest Path with Uniform Cost and A*
  
  EX 04 - Value Iteration, Policy Iteration on a grid state-space
  
  EX 05 - Trajectory planning with Dubins Path
  
  EX 06 - Collision checking with geometry
  
  EX 07 - Linear Programs for Trajectory Planning
  
  EX 08   (Final Project) 
  	- Rapidly-exploring Random Graph for trajectory planning
  	- PID controller for trajectory tracking
  	- Heuristics to avoid collision with other agents
